= Spring Cloud Stream Past, Present, and Future.

This repository contains the projects that are demoed during the breakout discussion.
These projects are meant to provide a quick start for experimenting with various features of Spring Cloud Function and Spring Cloud Stream
All samples use RabbitMQ as the Messaging Framework.

== Projects

=== Creek Functions
A collection of functions that can be used with the Producer, Function, and Consumer portions demonstration

=== Creek Producer
A boot application that will retrieve the creek data from the USGS for a selected set of creeks and send it to the specified destination (rabbit exchange).

=== Creek Transformer
A boot application transforms USGS Water Information System data to `CreekMeasurements` s.


=== Creek Consumer
A boot application that will consume the `CreekMeasurement` s from the stream and either log or send an sms message containing information on  the creeks that are safe-ish to kayak from the provided data.

NOTE: Do not determine if it is safe to kayak a stream, river, or any body of water based soley on the this analysis.  It is for demonstration purposes only.

=== Creek MeasurementRepository Consumer
A boot application that will consume the `CreekMeasurement` s from the stream and store them into a repository.

=== Stream POC
Single App POC that is used as a basic outline for the demo.

=== Running the full demo

==== Start the consumers
===== Send Creek Report via SMS

This will send the report to the specified phone number .   You must also provide the sms key.
[source,bash]
----
java -jar creekconsumer/target/creekconsumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  --spring.cloud.function.definition='generateReport|sms' --spring.cloud.stream.function.bindings.generateReportsms-in-0=input --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=sms --io.spring.smsKey=yourkey --io.spring.phoneNumber=+1XXXXXXXXXX
----

===== Write Creek Report to console

This will write the report to the console.
[source,bash]
----
java -jar creekconsumer/target/creekconsumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

==== Start the transformer
[source,bash]
----
java -jar creektransformer/target/creektransformer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

==== Start the Producer
[source,bash]
----
java -jar creekproducer/targecreekproducer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----


== Using Docker and Docker Compose

You can run the following script to build all the projects' docker images by running the following script:

[source,bash]
----
./create-images.sh
----

Or your can build each of the projects below independently as follows:

Build the docker images per Project:

[source,bash]
.creekconsumer
----
cd creekconsumer
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=creek-consumer
----

[source,bash]
.creekproducer
----
cd creekproducer
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=creek-producer
----


.[source,bash]
creektransformer
----
cd creektransformer
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=creek-transformer
----


[source,bash]
.creekmeasurementrepositoryconsumer
----
cd creekmeasurementrepositoryconsumer
./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName=creek-storage
----

=== Using docker-compose to launch the services.

Now, you can use the following `docker-compose.yml` file and execute:

[source,yaml]
----
include::docker-compose.yml[]
----

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

You can open your browser the http://localhost:15672[RabbitMQ Console^] to see the Exchanges and Queues created.

The port `3306` is exposed, so you can use a SQL Client for a MySQL/MariaDB and see the Table and data that stores the creek results.


=== Cleaning up

In another window and in the same folder where you ran the `docker-compose` command, you can run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose down
----
