= Spring Cloud Stream Past, Present, and Future.

This repository contains the projects that are demoed during the breakout discussion.
These projects are meant to provide a quick start for experimenting with various features of Spring Cloud Function and Spring Cloud Stream
All samples use RabbitMQ as the Messaging Framework.

== Projects

=== Creek Functions
A collection of functions that can be used with the Producer, Function, and Consumer portions demonstration

=== Creek Producer
A boot application that will retrieve the creek data from the USGS for a selected set of creeks and send it to the specified destination (rabbit exchange).

=== Creek Transformer
A boot application transforms USGS Water Information System data to `CreekMeasurements` s.


=== Creek Consumer
A boot application that will consume the `CreekMeasurement` s from the stream and either log or send an sms message containing information on  the creeks that are safe-ish to kayak from the provided data.

NOTE: Do not determine if it is safe to kayak a stream, river, or any body of water based soley on the this analysis.  It is for demonstration purposes only.

=== Creek MeasurementRepository Consumer
A boot application that will consume the `CreekMeasurement` s from the stream and store them into a repository.

=== Stream POC
Single App POC that is used as a basic outline for the demo.
